            <h1>Our Culture</h1>
            <p>The Quandamooka Peoples have lived on  Minjerribah or North Stradbroke Island for a very long time.</p>
            <p>Scientists say at least 25 000 years, however we say longer.  Our traditional estate – Quandamooka, the waters and islands of Central and Southern Moreton Bay and the coastal land and streams between the Brisbane to Logan Rivers, gave life to us in a time beyond memory.</p>
            <p>There are three clans that comprise the Peoples of the Quandamooka. They are the Nughi of Moorgumpin (now known as Moreton Island) and the Nunukul and Gorenpul of Terrangerri (Stradbroke Island).</p>
            <p>We hold our heads high as Traditional Owners with strong identity and culture.</p>
            <p>We are the Quandamooka People. We are the people of the sand and the water.</p>
